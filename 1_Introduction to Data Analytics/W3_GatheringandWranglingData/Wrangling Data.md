# Wrangling Data

Also known as data munging

Involves data exploration, transformation, validation, and making it available for a credible and meaningful analysis.

## What is Data Wrangling?

- Discovery(Exploration)

  Understanding data

  Creating wrangling plan

- Transformation

  Structuring the data(coz data might come from diff resources with various formats): Joint conbine columns, Union... rows

  Normalize and denormalize data: Reducing redundancy and inconsistency

  Cleaning data:Inaccuracy, Missing data, Incomplete, biases,Null, outliers.

  Enriching: 

- Validation:

- Publishing:delivery the data for downstream needs

## Tools for Data Wrangling

- Excel Power Query/Spreadsheets
- OpenRefineï¼š TSV, CSV, XLS, XML, JSON
- Google DataPrep
- Watson Studio Refinery
- Trifacta Wrangler
- Python
- R

## Data Cleaning
Poor quality data weakens an organization's cmpetitive standing and undermines critical business objectives.
Changes must be documented

### Inspection
- Detecting issues and errors
- Validating against rules and constraints
- Data profiling: Structure, content, Inter-relationships
- Visualizing data using statistical methods
### Cleaning

- Missing

  Filter out

  Imputation

- Duplicate

  Remove

- Irrelevant data

- Data type conversion

- Syntax error: white spaces, extra spaces, typos, formats need to be fixed

- Outliers

### Verification

Inspecting results to establish effectiveness and accuracy achieved as a result of the data cleaning

## Viewpoints: Data Preparation and Reliability

A relatively big proportion of Data Analyst's job involves gathering, preparing, and cleaning data



# summary

> - Structurally manipulate and combine the data using Joins and Unions.
> - Normalize data, that is, clean the database of unused and redundant data.
> - Denormalize data, that is, combine data from multiple tables into a single table so that it can be queried faster. 
>
> - Clean data, which involves profiling data to uncover quality issues, visualizing data to spot outliers, and fixing issues such as missing values, duplicate data, irrelevant data, inconsistent formats, syntax errors, and outliers.
>
> - Enrich data, which involves considering additional data points that could add value to the existing data set and lead to a more meaningful analysis.
