   >
   > During one summer break, I worked as a cashier in my relative's supermarket. On a busy Friday afternoon, many people were finishing work and buying groceries for the following week. Unfortunately, two of the cashiers were unavailable that day – one was sick, and the other had to leave early to pick up her child. So, a security guard and I were the only staff members in the supermarket that evening. As our 9 pm closing time approached, there was still a long line of customers waiting to check out, and more customers were still coming in. 
   >
   > I knew I wouldn't be able to finish checking everyone out on time, but I didn't want to disappoint the customers or break the supermarket's rules.
   >
   > So, when it reached 9 pm, I asked the security guard to close the main entrance, preventing any new customers from coming in. Then, I continued to serve the remaining customers while the security guard guided them out through a side door after they had finished shopping.
   >
   > In the end, I spent an extra 30 minutes finishing my task, ensuring all customers got what they needed and maintaining the supermarket's closing time rules.
   >
   >  I am usually able to make a quick decision that balance the interests of all stakeholders, even if it means sacrificing my own interests. But always prioritize my clients and team.

   >
   > **Once** we were placed into our group, the first thing we did was hold a meeting to introduce ourselves. I shared my background, skills, and interests, mentioning that I'm a tech-<u>savvy</u> student and can take more technical tasks if needed. I encouraged my teammates to do the same, which helped us understand each other's strengths and areas of expertise.
   >
   > **Throughout** the project, we assigned tasks based on our strengths and interests. The process wasn't always smooth sailing. At one point, I disagreed with a teammate, and we held different opinions. We couldn't reach an agreement during the team meeting, so we had a one-on-one discussion to resolve the issue. In the end, we found a compromise; sometimes, there isn't a perfect choice, but effective communication and understanding can lead to a relatively better agreement. After outlining our plan, we held online team meetings twice a week to discuss our progress, address problems, and find solutions to keep the project on track.

   >
   > 3At that time, I had everything but customer, I felt frustrated but not give up and started to think about what would i do if i wanna buy a pair of fake shoes online. I will search on Baidu, China's largest search engine. So how can i show my social media account when people search the key words. There are few ways dig out but only one feasible to a student like me. Write articles about counterfeit shoes and posting them on search engines that collaborated with Baidu. This way, sometimes the articles would appear in Baidu's search results and my social media account be hided in the artical.

   >
   > - I collaborated with three teammates from different disciplines: two data analysts, a traffic design major, and a mechanical engineering major. Initially, the team proposed working on separate topics and combining them into a single presentation. However, I realized that this approach wouldn't fulfill our tutor's teamwork requirements.
