# Analyzing And Mining Data

## Overview of Statistical Analysis

### 1Statistics

- Calculations such as average income, high-paid professions
- Analyzing vaccine data to ensure safety and efficacy
- Gaining greater insight into customer requirements to reduce customer churn
### 2Statistical Analysis
Statistical methods to a samole of data in order to develop an understanding of what that data represent

- Statistical methods help ensure Data is interpreted correctly

- Apparent relationships are meaningful

Type of statistics
- Descriptive statistics - Summarizing information about the sample: Easier to  understanding data , without inference.

  Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode

  DISPERSION:(measures of variability in dataset). VARIANCE(defines how far away the data points fall from the centre)ï¼›STANDARD DEVIATION(tells you how tightly your data is clustered around the mean), RANGE:(give you the distance between the smallest and largest values in your datasets)

  Skewness: is the measure whether the distribution of values is symmetrical around a central value or skewed left or right

- Inferential statistics - Making inference or generalizations about the broader population

  Hypothesis Testing

  Confidence Intervals

  Regression Analysis

## Data Mining 

Extracting knowledge from data

Interdisciplinary field that involves Recognition Technologies, Statistical Analysis, Mathematical Techniques

Goal(Aim) is identify correlations in data, find **patterns** and variations, understand **trends** and predict probilities.

#### Patterns and Trends

Pattern Recognition: Discovery of <u>regularities or commonalities</u> in data.

Trend is the <u>general</u> tendency of a set of data to change over time

- Classification
- Clustering: Group
- Anomaly or Outlier Detection
- Association Rule Mining
- Sequential Patterns
- Affinity Grouping
- Decision tree

> # Summary and Highlights
>
> In this lesson, you have learned the following information: 
>
> Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of numerical or quantitative data. 
>
> Statistical Analysis involves the use of statistical methods in order to develop an understanding of what the data represents. 
>
> Statistical Analysis can be:
>
> - Descriptive; that which provides a summary of what the data represents. Common measures include Central Tendency, Dispersion, and Skewness.
> - Inferential; that which involves making inferences, or generalizations, about data. Common measures include Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals, and Regression Analysis.
>
> Data Mining, simply put, is the process of extracting knowledge from data. It involves the use of pattern recognition technologies, statistical analysis, and mathematical techniques, in order to identify correlations, patterns, variations, and trends in data. 
>
> There are several techniques that can help mine data, such as, classifying attributes of data, clustering data into groups, establishing relationships between events, variables, and input and output. 
>
> A variety of software and tools are available for analyzing and mining data. Some of the popularly used ones include Spreadsheets, R-Language, Python, IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Watson Studio, and SAS, each with their own set of characteristics, strengths, limitations, and applications.
